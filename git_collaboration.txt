Base repository for countries. 
	
	https://github.com/oulib-swc/countries_base.git
	
	Fork the above reposotory into host github account to serve as a local base repo. For the start of the collaboration, then import from your local base repo to create a course repo of the countries. 


To review the steps of the collaboration exercise:
    
    Fork  (cloud)
    clone (cloud to local your copy)
    edits/changes (local)
    git add and commit to version (local)
    git push (local to cloud your copy)
    pull request (cloud) (notify upstream (owner) available changes)
    owner/upstream can accept, ask for more detail, decline

    This section pretty much follows the standard way to post a PR.

After upstream repository has accepted pull requests, we want to capture all those changes to our local repository. See source link for examples. 
    
    add remote upstream (local)
    fetch from upstream to forked(own) (local)
    merge upstream/master to local master (local)
    push to origin  (local to cloud) own
