Hi everyone,

Thank you for attending Software Carpentry last week! I hope you found it helpful.

Please take a few moments to fill out our post workshop survey if you haven't already (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/swc_post_workshop_v1?workshop_id=2017-01-12-ou). Our workshop is listed in the drop-down menu. This feedback helps the larger Software Carpentry Organization improve.

We’ve updated the etherpad with the lesson materials, references, and additional resources. You can check these out at http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-01-12-ou.
