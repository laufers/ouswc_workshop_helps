Software Carpentry is a two-day workshop designed to teach **beginning** computing skills and best practices to faculty, staff, and students.

This workshop will give participants the skills to get more done with less pain by introducing participants to foundational concepts of computing including how to work from the command line (BASH), get started learning a programming language, and use version control with Git and GitHub. Please see the [course website](course-website-url) for a more detailed description of what will be covered. 

OU Libraries regularly hosts Software Carpentry workshops. See the schedule below to select the workshop and programming language that works best for you.

This workshop is geared towards beginners and no prior experience is necessary. For intermediate and advanced coders, OU Libraries offers regular office hours with specialists. Stop by the [Digital Scholarship Lab](libraries.ou.edu/dsl) on Thursdays from 1PM to 3PM or the [Innovation Hub](http://www.ou.edu/innovationhub.html) on Fridays from 10AM to 12PM with any questions. Intermediate and advanced learners are invited to participate in workshops as helpers in order to learn more about the Software and Data Carpentry program and its pedagogy.
