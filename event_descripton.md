Software Carpentry is a two-day workshop desgined to teach **beginning** computing skills and best practices to faculty, staff, and students. 

By introducing participants to the basics of working with the command line (BASH), learning a programming language, and using version control with Git and GitHub, the workshop will give participants the skills to get more done with less pain. Please see the [course website](course-website-url) for a more detailed description of what will be covered. 

OU Libraries regularly hosts Software Carpentry workshops. See the schedule below to select the workshop and programming language that works best for you.
