This repository includes files that can be helpful to administrating and running  Carpentry workshops hosts by the University Libraries.

##### Text files to easily include in etherpad
* Resources_to_Continue_Learning.[md|txt]
    * A list of links to addition resources that learners can access after workshops. This can be sent out via Eventbrite or other email systems
* git_collaboration.txt
    * The outline of steps that learners will work through on the *Countries Git/GitHub Collabaoration* exercise.
* git_editors.txt
    * A list of 3rd party editors and how to install them for use by Git

##### Promotional text for workshops
* event_descripton.md Text for library event calendering and EventBright discription of who a workshop is targeting. Right now this is primarily for "new or beginner" learners. 

##### Admin files
* eventbrite_preworkshop_message.txt
    * Text for sending out via Eventbrite a reminder of the upcoming workshops and to have installed the appropriate software packages
* gather_screen.rtfd
    * A nice gathering screen that shows the links to the course website and the course etherpad. In addition, asks to have learners fill out the pre-workshop evaluation.
* ou_swc_report_templet.md
    * A markdown template file for use in preparing the final workshop report to be sent in to the Carpentry Foundation after a workshop has been hosted.
* ou_template_etherpad.etherpad and ou_template_etherpad.html
    * This template file is uploaded prior to a workshop to the workshop's etherpad. Careful here as you can only import once a etherpad extension file. Importing the html file will require some editing of the etherpad contents after imprort. 

##### Programs/software

* mk_attend_list.py
    * A very beta version of a python script that takes a list of learners names from the etherpad and the Eventbrite sign-up file that builds a simple cvs file of learner names, emails and domains/departments.
